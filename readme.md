## DriverPass Summary

**DriverPass** is a software implementation written for Liam, the owner of DriverPass
He wanted a system where students could schedule classes online and take online test.
This system would connect to the DMV API and make sure all information was alway current in real time.

## What went well

I think what when well was the requirements documentation, I think there were pretty good explicit instructions how to create them.

## Revise Documents

If I could revise a section it would be because I'm actually building out the application, I would get feedback on the requirements documentation, and I would fully define the UML diagram.

## Users needs

I interpreted the users needs from the transcript, there would have been clarifying questions if the application was real, so I made inferences about some topics. I broke down the functionalities into user stories in then into requirements. I took a systems approach to user stories to find the system requirements. It is important to consider the users needs so you build the system the way the user wants it built, and you don't have to go back and make changes. But you also have to guide the user along as they are not technical and may not be aware of what is possible and whats improbable.

## Design software approach

I approach designing software from an agile perspective. First gather requirements. Second analyze the requirements. With the requirements gathered and analyzed we can begin to map out the system. Depending on the complexity we have to make diagrams. The complexity dictates the type and details of the diagrams. These will be used to build user stories, or these can be built from user stories when interviewing stakeholders. Next the system has to be developed. Peice by piece with TDD for best results. Along the way functionality is tested and sent to the user with a minimul viable product. Added functionality is then added tested and sent to the user. This repeats in iteration until the development is complete, the initial developement, then the system goes into a maintaince phase where there will be training support bug fixes and new requested functionality.
